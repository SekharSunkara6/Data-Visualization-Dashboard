# Data-Visualization-Dashboard

Data Visualization Dashboard
Test Assignment 
The objective of this assignment is to create a data visualization dashboard as per as instructions given below. 

Data
Json file: jsondata.json
<br>

# Data Visualization Dashboard
- Use given json data
- Create a MongoDB database from the Json data given.
- Use MERN Stack or MEAN Stack or react native to design and develop a dashboard. 
- For charts or visualizations, you can use any of the following:
1) D3.js (highly recommended) 
2) chart.js
3) fusioncharts
4) plotly.js
5) google charts
6) highcharts
 etc.
- Use any creative visual that you can create using the data to generate insights
- You must use the given data only.
- Develop any creative visualization that you like most, using provided data in json.
- Interactive graphs, charts, and visuals are recommended
- The dashboard should read the data from the MongoDB database.
- Create API in node,js to get data from the MongoDB

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
